# scieintific data handling

This is repositry of random scripts and programs that I wrote at different time for different purposes. This includes different languages as well.

These scripts are not entirely my creations as some parts of the code might have been taken from different online sources. I have heavily modified the codes if I took those from different sources for my use case and the original codes will be aound 30 percent and remainig 70 percent is my work.

This repositoy is incomplete, the scripts I create will be added as and when its needed
