# random_codes
this is repositry of random scripts and programs that i wrote at different time for different purposes. this includes different languages as well.

These scripts are not entirely my creations as some parts of the code might have been taken from different online sources. Since these are written at different times in four or five years, I hvae lost the links for those sources and cant credit them here specifically.

I have heavily modified the codes if I took those from different sources for my use case and the original codes will be aound 30 percent and remainig 70 percent is my owrk.

this repositoy is incomplete adnthe scripts i create will be added here time by time basis.
